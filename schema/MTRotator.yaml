type: object
properties:
  max_ccw_following_error:
    description: >-
      The maximum difference (in degrees) between the camera rotator actual position and the
      camera cable wrap actual position, beyond which the rotator is halted and sent to FAULT state.
    type: number
    exclusiveMinimum: 0
    default: 2.2
  num_ccw_following_errors:
    description: >-
      The number of sequential camera cable wrap following errors required before halting the rotator.
      A value of 1 will fail at the first error. A value of 3 avoids triggering on an outlier.
      Note that the value is tested each time rotator telemetry arrives.
